Title: "HealthHarmony", Healthcare appointment system
SCOPE: The goal of this project is to develop a healthcare appointment system that will simplify and improve the efficiency of managing patient appointments and medical records. Patients will have access to a simple and interactive web application where they can sign up, log in, book appointments, and review their medical history and doctors will use a desktop application to organize their schedules, access patient information, and update treatment plans. The system will use technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React for the web application, and C#, JSON and REST API for the desktop application. This system will support secure login and CRUD operations to guarantee effective and seamless healthcare administration for both patients and medical staff.
